## A bit of context

The [jdt-codegen](https://github.com/jsontypedef/json-typedef-codegen) is a really useful CLI to generate typings in different languages from JSON Typedef schemas file. The only issue is that it's not user friendly to install and keep updated, because it is not released to any package manager, so we need to manually download the binary. We've [opened a ticket](https://github.com/jsontypedef/json-typedef-codegen/issues/36#issuecomment-930362732) on the project's official repo, but the maintainer decided to not include such release mechanisme and leave this task to the community.
